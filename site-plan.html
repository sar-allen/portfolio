      <p>
        Here I would introduce myself with something like:
      </p>
      <p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio site! My name is Sarah Allen and I am currently a student at Brigham Young University- Idaho studying Graphic Design with an emphasis in User Experience and Interface (UX/UI). Therefore, this site showcases the various projects I have completed whilst mainly being a student on my "Portfolio" page. These include book covers I have created, drawings I've done, projects I've completed for publication, and several more. This site also includes my Resume, which is available under the "Resume" page and shows my contact information, some information about me and that which I've done.</p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Portfolio</h3>
      <p>
        Here will be information about each of the pieces of my portfolio: 
      </p>
      <p>
        “Leaving the Red Room” Book Cover:
          This was a design concept I had for a “Jane Eyre book cover” which was featured and published in the BYU-Idaho’s Art and Literary Journal “Outlet” in 2023. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Burgundy Magazine:
        For this magazine, I focused on the color "Burgundy," in the shade #640b20, and that which the color offers. Therefore, all of the magazine content is curated around this color, with articles on Burgundy's influence on cooking, fashion, people, science, and makeup. 
          The Process:
          Once I had chosen the color "Burgundy," I had to do some research on what the color represented, what elements it had, etc in order to recognize what I could do with the color for my articles, graphic components, and more. Following the preliminary research, I used ChatGPT (as approved by my Professor) to generate two feature articles, an Editor's letter, two department pages, and an icon page. Once I knew what my articles would be about, I could focus on designing the type and graphic elements. 
        Ultimately, 
          Fonts used: 
            Body Copy: Trade Gothic in Regular and Italic 
            Headlines: Bodoni 72 in Bold or LTC Bodoni 175 Pro in Regular 
            Subheadlines in Body Copy: Trade Gothic in Bold 
            Pull-Out Quotes: Trade Gothic in Bold Italic
            Page Numbers: LTC Bodoni 175 Pro in Regular 
            Thematic Elements: the use of bleeding images on almost all of the spreads, the burgundy color blocks and lines, the burgundy titles, etc. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Loves Baking Company:
          For this project, I was tasked with creating a brand around a
          baking company located out of Love, Texas. Thus, "Love's
          Baking Company," was founded, with its main charm being
          the love found within each item it produces.
          The finished product for the branding consists of its logotype,
          three types of flour packaging, menus for the bakery location,
          branded merchandise (aka "swag"), and an invoice, which
          are all catered to the main audience of home bakers, typically
          women, between the ages of 20-45 years old.
      </p>
      <p>
        Leaky Faucets and Me: This was a work I designed that got published in BYU-I’s literary and art journal, “The Outlet.” We worked on designing this journal over the course of over a month and it was a difficult project, but one that helped us understand how a real design studio works, how to utilize several elements and principles of design, etc.
      </p>
      <p>There will also be information concerning the drawings and other works not mentioned above. Instead of describing more of the design process, I will probably aim for more of when they were created and what they are named.</p>

        I will make this page based on the instructions from W3 Schools "How To" on Portfolio Gallery's: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_portfolio_gallery.asp Also, this is a rough draft, so on the actual page, there will be several different sizes of images and things to showcase my favorite/best works better, create good visual hierarchy, etc.
